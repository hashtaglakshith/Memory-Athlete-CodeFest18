#Development
This software is written using visual C# language and user interface is designed using Metro Framework and Visual Studio 2015 IDE. (6000 lines Appr.)
SQL Database is used and initially managed by SQL Server Management Studio 17.9
Python language has also used in some occasions.

#Objectives
 Uplift Self Learning in to the next Level.
 Introducing Widely Used Study Techniques to Sri Lankan students
 Collaborating study efforts of every user, together to improve the productivity at individual level
 Using Machine Learning to develop the concept of Self Learning
 
#Usage of study techniques
 Method of loci (Memory Palace)
 Spaced Repetition

#Method of loci
Method of loci is the main Feature of the software. Various Researches has shown that Cognitive Memory is long lasting than any. The Key base of the method of loci is Cognitive Memory. The method of loci (loci being Latin for "places") is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one's environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. 
Today this study technique is widely used with slight modifications and differentiations. In this software user can memorize lists of information using that technique. In case of more advanced memorization user can break down information and then memorize.


#Spaced Repetition
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. In this software user can review what he or she learnt using method of loci with spaced repetitions. This technique massively increases the robustness of memorized information. As an example, once user memorized something, Software notify him to review it in specific time periods. Repetition routine is somewhat like once a day, once two days, once a week and so on. 

#Features
User can memorize information using method of loci
User can make his own Test questions to test his memory whenever he/she wants
Can store a target goal
Better study environment
Share Knowledge
Seek extra knowledge in Wikipedia
Suggesting Similar users

#Usage of machine learning
Almost every location which software process results for the user Cosine Similarity algorithm is used.
And also when searching resources this algorithm also used for better user experience.
This software can suggest similar users and their resources. This is done by the information collected at the first when user makes his account on software and Clustering them. The algorithm used here is  K-Nearest Neighbors.
Cosine Similarity algorithm is programmed in C# and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is programmed in python

#Expected future development
Making the software available online and Develop the Community.
Adding Built-in Tutorials and Lessons
Support Image and Video input.
Developing Used machine learning Algorithm to improve productivity.
Using Deep Learning Automate every possible action.
